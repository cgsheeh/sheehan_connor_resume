\textbf{RE: Production Engineer, Intern/Co-Op (2015)}

\small{
With regard to the above opportunity, I am forwarding my resume for your consideration.

I am currently enrolled in my third year of the Software Engineering and Co-Op program at McMaster University in Hamilton, Ontario. My education has provided me with many skills and experiences that a production engineer must possess to be able to move fast and tackle complex problems. Courses from basic programming to concurrent software design have given me a structured method of developing my technical abilities and supplementing my personal experimentations. Due to this exposure, I have the ability to rapidly learn new development languages as well as pick up frameworks and APIs. In line with Facebook's core belief in making the world more open and connected, I completed a project of redeveloping the groundbreaking \textit{OpenBazaar} application using engineering methods and tools. 

For the past three summers, I have been employed at the University of Ontario Institute of Technology. In my first two summers I was a computer imaging assistant. My role was to assist three full time computer imaging technologists in the development of desktop and laptop images for institutionally owned computers, as well as work with other student employees in an imaging lab to prepare thousands of computers for distribution. This experience allowed me to learn many details about large scale imaging, which will be invaluable in a Production Engineering position. The third summer I was given a promotion to software packager. Responsibilities included gathering licensing and installation files for software titles and compiling an installation script for automated deployments through the LANDesk Management Suite. During this time, when image configurations were updated some deployments would break, leading to many support calls. In collaboration with my colleague, I reverse engineered the deployment portal and built an automated test suite; this resulted in fewer support calls and reduced workload as the testing could now be performed without monitoring.


I would be extremely interested in joining your team for a co-op term to learn from a group of people equally as enthusiastic as I am. I look forward to hearing from you to discuss my skills and qualifications further. Please contact me via my email or phone number. Thank you for considering me in this position.}
