\small{
I am currently enrolled in the Software Engineering and Co-Op program at McMaster University and would like to make an inquiry into obtaining a 12 month co-op position at your company. I have reviewed your company's website and am certain that I will make an excellent addition to your corporate culture and products.

My education at McMaster University has provided me with many skills and experiences which will be beneficial to your organization. Courses from basic programming to concurrent software design have given me a solid background in coding which I still develop today. Hardware based courses provided me with an understanding of low level computing abstractions and physical implementations of digital logic. Essential to any engineering education is a detailed mathematics background. This includes four calculus courses and several courses in discrete maths, algorithms and their applications. This body of technical knowledge will help me find the solution to any problem quickly and effectively.

Aside from my education, I have also been employed at the University of Ontario Institute of Technology for the past three summers. In my first two summers I was a computer imaging assistant. My role was to assist three full time computer imaging technologists in the development of desktop and laptop images for institutionally owned computers, as well as work with other student employees in an imaging lab to prepare thousands of computers for distribution. This experience helped me develop my soft computer skills and learn many details about enterprise computing. The third summer I was given a promotion to software packager. My charge was to gather the correct licensing and installation files and compile an installation script for automated deployments through the LANDesk Management Suite. This job provided me with extensive programming experience as well as knowledge of different deployment technologies and frameworks. All of this experience will be beneficial to your organization.

I would be extremely interested in joining your team for a co-op term to learn from a group of people equally as enthusiastic as I am. I look forward to hearing from you to discuss my skills and qualifications further. Please contact me via the Engineering Co-Op and Career Services office (engcoop@mcmaster.ca), or via my email (sheehacg@mcmaster.ca). Thank you for considering me in this position.}
