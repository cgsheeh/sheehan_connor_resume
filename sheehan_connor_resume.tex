\textbf{RE: Build and Release Intern - Toronto (ID: ofA51fwF)}

\iffalse
To whom it may concern,

My name is Connor Sheehan, I am an engineering student at McMaster University in Hamilton, Ontario. I believe that in the formal sense, engineering is the application of mathematics and physical sciences to solve complex, open ended problems. In practice, engineering is the development and optimization of products that make human life better and benefit society as a whole. The Mozilla Foundation has always been a glowing example of excellence in engineering  and social enrichment, setting a standard to which others strive to achieve. If I were afforded the opportunity to work at Mozilla, I would hope to develop my technical knowledge while contributing to a team of professionals who embody the principles of the Mozilla Manifesto. Internet accessibility is a force for empowerment, a tool for revolution and one of the most important movements of our time - and I would love to begin my engineering career contributing to the cause.

Within Mozilla, I feel that I am an excellent fit for the build and release intern position due to my education as well as my work experience. I am currently completing my third year of the software engineering program at McMaster University in Hamilton, Ontario. During this time I have practiced the fundamental principles of software engineering that will give me the ability to learn more advanced concepts effectively. In the workplace, I have been a part of a team of imagers building and deploying operating system configurations to thousands of laptops. I have also worked as a software packager, during which I created and deployed automated setup scripts for educational software titles. I also implemented a virtualized test environment to increase automation and efficiency. Both of these positions, combined with my education is what makes me confident that I will be able to make an impact as an intern at Mozilla.

I would be extremely interested in joining the build and release team at Mozilla for a co-op term to learn from a group of people equally as enthusiastic as I am. I look forward to hearing from you to discuss my skills and qualifications further. Please contact me via my email (sheehacg@mcmaster.ca) or mobile phone number (905 767 6049). Thank you for considering me in this position.


Best regards,

Connor Sheehan
